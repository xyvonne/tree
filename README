This is an implementation in C++14 of trees with generic type (the same type
for each node and leaf) and arbitrary arity (number of children).
Compiling the source code yields the following binary files:

* demo: a little demonstration for the Tree and BinaryTree classes.
* eval: an arithmetic expression evaluator.
* rd: a directory recursive listing utility, like the UNIX/MS-DOS "tree".

A comprehensive documentation about the project layout, as well with the
usage and the implementation, can be found in the ./doc folder.
