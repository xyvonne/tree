/**
 * This class is the core of our directory search program. An instance of it
 * is constructed from the top directory path (i.e., the directory which
 * all subdirectories are to be read from).
 * Upon success, the reading yields a table, which is actually a vector of
 * (key, value) pairs; here, a key is a directory currently being read, and a
 * value is its corresponding vector of (direct) subdirectories.
 * In this table, directories are stored as strings in the following format:
 * root_path/subdir/subsubdir/... Keeping the whole names makes the keys
 * pairwise distinct.
 * If an (I/O) error occurs upon reading the top directory, an
 * std::error_condition is thrown. If a similar error later occurs, no
 * exception is thrown, and an undefined behavior results; most of the
 * times, the result will be valid, but incomplete.
 * Once the table is built, the last part of the job is made by the
 * "rd.cc" file. This table can be directly passed to a Tree constructor,
 * and the resulting tree can be easily pretty-printed with the
 * Tree::to_string() method, yielding the desired result.
