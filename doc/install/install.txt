To build this project, you only need:
- a Unix/Linux x64 distribution
- GNU Make
- C++14 or more recent
- g++, the GNU C++ compiler (source files can be compiled manually with a
different compiler, though).

For installation, just clone/download this repo, and run make at the root of
the installation folder. Binary files are placed in this folder too.

The provided Makefile includes the following rules:
- all: default and main rule: generate all the 3 binary files: demo, eval, rd.
- demo: generate the binary file demo.
- eval: generate the binary file eval.
- rd: generate the binary file rd.
- clean: remove the ./build directory (object files). Binary files are kept.
- mrproper: remove the ./build directory and the binary files.
