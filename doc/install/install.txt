To build this project, you only need:

- a Unix/Linux x64 distribution
- C++14 or more recent
- g++, the GNU C++ compiler (source files can be compiled manually with a
different compiler, though).

For the installation, just clone/download this repo, and run make at the
root of the installation folder. Binary files are generated in this folder too.
