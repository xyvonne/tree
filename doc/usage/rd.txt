rd is a directory recursive listing utility.
It is an implementation of the main part of the well-known Unix/MS-DOS
utility "tree":
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(command)#cite_note-5

"./rd" is equivalent to "./rd .".
"./rd path" is equivalent to "tree path -d -I .",
so only visible directories (those who do not start with '.') are listed.

rd takes at most 1 argument, and prints errors on stderr (whereas tree prints
errors on stdout).

Exit codes:
0: success
1: the given argument is not a directory, or an I/O error occured
2: too many arguments
